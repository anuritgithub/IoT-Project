# IoT-Project
The Internet of Things (IoT) is a hot issue with significant technical, social, and economic implications especially as the world's population is growing , the number of health-related issues is on itâ€™s peak .This  has lead to necessitating the integration of our healthcare system, which is much more faster than the human way of doing things. It can meet the needs of today's massive population. In this study, we  will explore methods of speeding up our healthcare system by modifying the healthcare industry's system and connecting it with the internet using network connectivity methods and various components of notworking. Integration of the healthcare industries improves the accuracy of reports, saves time, is more reliable, and improves communication among all levels of the healthcare system. It can makes a contribution by outlining ways to enable worldwide connectivity between the Internet of Things (IoT) and medical contexts. The necessity to integrate everyone in a global environment presents a serious challenge to everyone. From the smallest sensor to the massive amounts of data collected, this transformation is redefining the way we think about healthcare.
